- Loading and error states

## Stack

- Expo + React Native + TypeScript
- react-native-vision-camera
- Built-in Vision Camera code scanner (ML Kit)
- React Navigation Native Stack
- Axios

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Generate native projects (required for Vision Camera + ML Kit plugins):

```bash
npx expo prebuild
```

3. Run on Android:

```bash
npm run android
```

4. Run on iOS (macOS only):

```bash
npm run ios
```

## API Endpoint

The app sends:

```json
{
  "barcode": "<detected-value>"
}
```

to:

`POST ${EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL}/api/scan`

Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in your environment config.

## Notes

- Vision Camera barcode scanning does not run in Expo Go; use a dev build or prebuilt native run.
- Camera permission prompt is handled in-app.
